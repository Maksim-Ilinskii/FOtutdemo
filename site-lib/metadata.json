Then we go to our quest file → Quest Aliases and open FirstObjective in the list of Alias Names.\n<br><img src=\"attachments/image/basic-fetch-quest-1677678156830.jpeg\" target=\"_self\">\nThen check that everything is ok:\n<br><img src=\"attachments/image/basic-fetch-quest-1677678219185.jpeg\" target=\"_self\">Sometimes you might get unknown things here. It's pretty rare generally and usually it solves itself when you hit \"Yes\" to that. But it's best to make sure.When you get those warnings, read them through, take them seriously, and consider what you're about to delete so you won't have any problems.\nFor this tutorial, we're going to select a rare blow torch and put it on the ground.\n<br><img src=\"attachments/image/basic-fetch-quest-1677678488657.jpeg\" target=\"_self\">\nNow you should create an activator. You can either select a HotelBell object:\n<br><img src=\"attachments/image/basic-fetch-quest-1677678665908.jpeg\" target=\"_self\"><br>Note\nI made a custom activator from static object by following <a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"Creation Kit make static objects look like activators\" data-href=\"Creation Kit make static objects look like activators\" href=\"games/fallout-4/fallout-4-modding/creation-kit-make-static-objects-look-like-activators.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">this</a> tutorial. I made it a phone.\nNote\nIn the example bellow, the Bell's ID is called kgQuest_TurnInBell. Further in this tutorial, you'll see the name mxpQuest_TurnInBell.\n<br><img src=\"attachments/image/basic-fetch-quest-1677679041070.jpeg\" target=\"_self\">OR,you can select the phone with the activator you've made previously on the workbench:<br><img src=\"attachments/image/basic-fetch-quest-1677679202384.jpeg\" target=\"_self\">A few notes first:Note\nUse Designer Notes field as a reminder what Player does on a certain stage of the quest. To create a stage, find your quest if you already created it and double click it. Then, right-click on the left field → New\n<br><img src=\"attachments/image/basic-fetch-quest-1677679740484.jpeg\" target=\"_self\">\nPut the number of the stage\n<br><img src=\"attachments/image/basic-fetch-quest-1677679877210.jpeg\" target=\"_self\">\nEverything will be greyed out. We need to create a new log entry:\n<br><img src=\"attachments/image/basic-fetch-quest-1677680003737.jpeg\" target=\"_self\">\nThen I put a Designer Note: Player rang the phone. In log entry you can enter what will be in Pip Boy's log.\n<br><img src=\"attachments/image/basic-fetch-quest-1677680323941.jpeg\" target=\"_self\">Now that we schemed the flow of the quests, we need to arrange so that quest know about these things. So these stages can actually be reached.\nNow we go to our blowtorch\nWe go to Gameplay → Papyrus Manager and search for the script defaultrefoncontainerchangedto and drag it to the objects Scripts tab\n<br><img src=\"attachments/cropped_set-stage-upon-looting-an-object-1677675243411.png\" target=\"_self\" style=\"width: 900px; max-width: 100%;\">Note\nThe idea with containers is that any NPC or the player is a container as well. So they pick up an item, it goes into their inventory (=container). When item is out in the world it's not in the container, so we want to know it moved into container (defaultrefoncontainerchangedto). So we're monitoring for when this changes to a container. Generally NPCs don't pick up random items. The items don't put into containers automatically, and we can actually set this up so that the only Player can do it, but generally we don't need to worry about it. Then, double-click defaultrefoncontainerchangedto)\nDouble click MyQuest in the opened window\nOn the right of the window, on PickObject select your quest:\n<br><img src=\"attachments/image/set-stage-upon-looting-an-object-1677677183076.jpeg\" target=\"_self\">\nClick StageToSet and enter value of the stage this item should be connected to.\n<br><img src=\"attachments/image/set-stage-upon-looting-an-object-1677677384942.jpeg\" target=\"_self\">\nA player can run into say, second stage of the quest too early and trigger it. Then we use PrereqStage and put the stage the player should trigger before the second stage can be triggered.\n<br><img src=\"attachments/image/set-stage-upon-looting-an-object-1677677685035.jpeg\" target=\"_self\">\nWe can also make sure that only the player can pick it up\n<br><img src=\"attachments/image/basic-fetch-quest-1677680947190.jpeg\" target=\"_self\">TurnOffStage means if it reaches that stage in your quest, then it should no longer do these things. So if something else happened first… It can be an interesting way to prevent quests that you don't want to fire later. For example, you had an NPC that you had to turn into this item, and they died, then maybe you don't want picking up the torch and triggering the quest. Because that NPC is dead, and you couldn't turn it into them anyway. The document String says:\nIf the quest stage is equal or greater than TurnOffStage, further events are ignored\nNote\nThis stage does not actually have to be set—any quest stage equal or higher will turn off this script. ItemChangedTo — his is the way to set up which container it went to. So you could do things like monitoring for a player putting an item into particular container-- maybe you want to only respond to them-- you want to tell them to put it in the workbench, and then you could set up this ItemChangedToReferences to point to all bunch of different workshops or something like that.\nOr tell them to put it into a very specific locker somewhere that you set up in the world.Now we want the stage 30 to happen when the Player clicks on the bell/phone. We double-click it → Go to Scripts Tab → Add and search for defaultrefonactivate<br><img src=\"attachments/image/basic-fetch-quest-1677682653020.jpeg\" target=\"_self\">In the open window we set up:\nMyQuest - our quest again StageToSet to 30.\nWe also set PreReq stage to 20 (i.e. prev stage)\n<br><img src=\"attachments/image/basic-fetch-quest-1677682963978.jpeg\" target=\"_self\">Warning\nAny time you go to the Objectives tab, make sure you press Ok on your forms and save.

It is more performant to use ref types. It's then these items don't have to remain in memory for as long. But when you're using Bethesda stuff or even if you're at modding another mod, it's best not to do that because you risk introducing incompatible edits to that mod.\nThe last thing you have to do, is to flag Quest Object in Reference Alias window. It prevents player from selling or dropping the object.\n<br><img src=\"attachments/image/basic-fetch-quest-1677684871460.jpeg\" target=\"_self\">\n(possible) Alternative way to make it a quest object: Double-click an object (Blowtorch, in our case)\nEdit the Base\n<br>Right-click on the Keyword field -&gt; Add\n<img src=\"attachments/image/basic-fetch-quest-1677686391197.jpeg\" target=\"_self\">\nSearch for NotJunkJetAmmo You can rename your Object and change its ID: <br><img src=\"attachments/image/basic-fetch-quest-1677686746714.jpeg\" target=\"_self\">In the pop-up window, click \"Yes\":<br><img src=\"attachments/image/basic-fetch-quest-1677686819330.jpeg\" target=\"_self\">Now we want our bell/phone to be the same.\nOpen your quest file -&gt; Quest Alias tab\nRight click - &gt; New Reference Alias\n<br><img src=\"attachments/image/basic-fetch-quest-1677687229953.jpeg\" target=\"_self\">In the open window:\nGive Alias Name\nClick Specific Reference Select Forced Reference\n<br><img src=\"attachments/image/basic-fetch-quest-1677687403906.jpeg\" target=\"_self\">\nIn the open window: Select Reference in Render Window\nIn Render Window, double-click on the phone/bell\n<br><img src=\"attachments/image/basic-fetch-quest-1677687561306.jpeg\" target=\"_self\">\nClick ok.

Find the Papyrus Fragment section and enter SetObjectiveDisplayed(10) — where 10 being a number of the stage index. <br>\nThen, click Compile\n<img src=\"attachments/image/basic-fetch-quest-1677693320255.jpeg\" target=\"_self\"> On Stage 2, in Papyrus Fragment enter 1SetObjectiveCompleted(10)2SetObjectiveDisplayed(20)\nOn stage 3 enter: 1SetObjectiveCompleted(20)Note\nAlternatively, you can use this code:\n1CompleteAllObjectives()\nThis one is useful when you have optional objectives or when you forgot to mark completed one of the stages.\nThere are two ways, and the second one is most recommended, because it's safer.<br><a data-href=\"Note about Papyrus Fragments\" href=\"games/fallout-4/fallout-4-modding/note-about-papyrus-fragments.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Note about Papyrus Fragments</a>You can add the property of your item and just tell the game to remove that from the player's inventory.To do that, click on Properties:<br><img src=\"attachments/image/basic-fetch-quest-1677745316252.jpeg\" target=\"_self\">Click Add Property (Marked red in the screenshot bellow).

This is an odd mix up only Bethesda knows where it comes from.<br><img src=\"attachments/image/basic-fetch-quest-1677745715710.jpeg\" target=\"_self\">Now we can give it a Name \"Blow Torch\", but there's a better way.If we copy the exact name of our object,it will automatically fill in the property.<br><img src=\"attachments/image/basic-fetch-quest-1677749263259.jpeg\" target=\"_self\"><br><img src=\"attachments/image/basic-fetch-quest-1677749363678.jpeg\" target=\"_self\">In the next window, you'll see a little pencil like it's edited. If we click on it, it'll automatically select our item. So it's a nice little handy shortcut.<br><img src=\"attachments/image/basic-fetch-quest-1677748609719.jpeg\" target=\"_self\">Now this script can reference this particular type of item. Now we're going to fiddle with papyrus a bit.1CompleteAllObjectives()23Game.GetPlayer()RemoveItem(mxpBlowtorch_Rare)By Game.GetPlayer(), you get access to the player, you can call different functions on them, etc.Keep in mind! You can't just put the name of an item (mpxBlowtorch_Rare in our case) into RemoveItem(mxpBlowtorch_Rare) unless it's a property! So what you are typing in is the property name. Because we used the same name for the property, it does look like we're typing in just the name, but in reality we don't. Don't get confused! Set up the property properly first.\nAlso, there's a little trick.\nIf you put a comma and -1, that tells it to remove ALL of the item that the player has. 1CompleteAllObjectives()23Game.GetPlayer()RemoveItem(mxpBlowtorch_Rare, -1)\nAlternatively, -1 can be the number you want to remove. One common thing people use it is to remove caps from the player, make them buy things — you could do remove item.\nThere's a property for caps it's a misc item called caps001, and then you put the number of caps you want to remove from them.\nConclusion:So this method would typically work. This would get rid of the item from the inventory, because we know this is the only one we placed, and this is the only that the player can have.The problem with this method is that often you'll be using things that aren't rare unique quest items. It could be that maybe you wanted the player to get a hunting rifle. We don't want to just remove any hunting rifle, we want specifically the one that is a quest item in our alias because that's the one they can't get rid of.It's considered a bad move most of the time. A better way to do it is to instead grab the item from the alias itself. (Go to Method #2)Note\nto comment out the code in Papyrus, put semicolon in front of the line\n1CompleteAllObjectives()23;Game.GetPlayer()RemoveItem(mxpBlowtorch_Rare, -1)So we need the property to point to alias.Let's go to Quest Aliases and rename FirstObjective to Blowtorch. Double-click on FirstObjective and in the open window, rename it and hit \"Ok\".<br><img src=\"attachments/image/basic-fetch-quest-1677751105115.jpeg\" target=\"_self\"><br><img src=\"attachments/image/basic-fetch-quest-1677751064915.jpeg\" target=\"_self\">\nGo back to Quest Stages -&gt; Select the last objectives\nclick Properties in Papyrus Fragment\nIn the open window, click Add Property\n<br><img src=\"attachments/image/basic-fetch-quest-1677745384914.jpeg\" target=\"_self\">This time we're going to use the Type: Reference Alias and the Name: BlowtorchAlias.<br><img src=\"attachments/image/basic-fetch-quest-1677751736719.jpeg\" target=\"_self\">Note\nThere's a trick in the latter one: if you use the name of the actual alias, and you add the word \"Alias\" after, it will automatically fill. <br><img src=\"attachments/image/basic-fetch-quest-1677751751300.jpeg\" target=\"_self\">Click Pick Alias and choose it:<br><img src=\"attachments/image/basic-fetch-quest-1677751859416.jpeg\" target=\"_self\">So now we get back to the last stage's Papyrus Fragment and type in: 1CompleteAllObjectives()23Game.GetPlayer().RemoveItem(BlowtorchAlias.GetRef())Just for the sake of comparison with the first method, I'll leave it here:1CompleteAllObjectives()23;Game.GetPlayer().RemoveItem(mxpBlowtorch_Rare, -1) — instead of this you put this:45Game.GetPlayer().RemoveItem(BlowtorchAlias.GetRef(), -1)Alias is just an invisible box that holds something in it. So to get the thing in the box, we do .GetRef(). And we don't need to use -1 because there's only one item. By default, if you don't put the second property after comma , , it'll just emove one item.That's it!","aliases":[],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":["#inbox"],"headers":[{"heading":"1.
