For that, you should use log command from step 1\nThere are 2 environments where you can do that on Windows: powershell, or git bash. And there are 2 options to do that. 1$deletedFiles = git diff --name-only --diff-filter=D -- \"attachments/image\"2foreach ($file in $deletedFiles) {3 git restore --source=&lt;commit_hash&gt; --staged -- $file4}Use the commit hash from the log you've seen on step 1, instead of the &lt;commit_hash&gt;. E.g: 097046f88d2ffc14b24b35a506b4b574ee0241eb1$deletedFiles = git diff --name-only --diff-filter=D -- attachments/image2foreach ($file in $deletedFiles) {3 git restore --source=097046f88d2ffc14b24b35a506b4b574ee0241eb --staged -- $file4}\nStep 1: The command git diff --name-only --diff-filter=D -- attachments/image lists all deleted files in the attachments/image directory.\nStep 2: The loop (foreach) iterates over each deleted file.\nStep 3: The git restore command is run for each file, using a specific commit hash (&lt;commit_hash&gt;). The commit hash can be one you manually choose (for example, the commit where the file was last present).\nResult: Each deleted file is restored from one specific commit (the commit hash you provide).\n1$deletedFiles = git diff --name-only --diff-filter=D -- \"attachments/image\"2$commitHashes = git rev-list --all34foreach ($commitHash in $commitHashes) {5 foreach ($file in $deletedFiles) {6 git restore --source=$commitHash --staged -- $file7 }8}9\nStep 1: The command git diff --name-only --diff-filter=D -- attachments/image lists all deleted files in the attachments/image directory (same as in Code No. 1).\nStep 2: The command git rev-list --all retrieves all commit hashes in the repository (from the entire commit history).\nStep 3: The outer foreach loop iterates through all commits (from $commitHashes).\nStep 4: The inner foreach loop iterates through each of the deleted files.\nStep 5: The git restore command restores each deleted file from every commit one by one.\nResult: Each deleted file is restored from every commit in the repository where it exists (even if it was deleted in a later commit). This can result in multiple restorations for the same file.\n1# List deleted files in attachments/image2deletedFiles=$(git diff --name-only --diff-filter=D -- attachments/image)34# Loop through each deleted file and restore it from a specific commit5for file in $deletedFiles; do6 git restore --source=&lt;commit_hash&gt; --staged -- \"$file\"7done8\nVariable assignment: In Git Bash, you use $(...) for command substitution, which works similarly to $() in PowerShell.\nLooping: The for file in $deletedFiles; do ... done loop is standard in Bash for iterating through a list of items.\nRestoring: The git restore command is the same, but ensure to replace &lt;commit_hash&gt; with the actual commit hash.\n1# List deleted files in attachments/image2deletedFiles=$(git diff --name-only --diff-filter=D -- attachments/image)34# Get all commit hashes in the repository5commitHashes=$(git rev-list --all)67# Loop through each commit hash and each deleted file8for commitHash in $commitHashes; do9 for file in $deletedFiles; do10 git restore --source=$commitHash --staged -- \"$file\"11 done12done\nVariable assignment: Again, use $(...) for both the $deletedFiles and $commitHashes variables.\nLooping: We use nested for loops to iterate over each commit hash and each deleted file.\nRestoring: The git restore command works the same way, restoring the deleted files from each commit. Variable assignment: In Bash, you assign values to variables without $ in front of the variable name when assigning (e.g., deletedFiles=...), and you use $ to reference them when used.\nLooping: The
